# EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE Platform
This single repository contains three main sections regarding all the aspects of the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform.

All the details can be find inside each directory.

## [`code_testbed`](code_testbed)
This code is aimed to control the pendulum of the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform to perform several type of experiments on a given target, and gather the sensor measurements that will be used to estimate the stability under certain perturbations.

## [`Dysturbance pi`](dysturbance_pi)
This code is aimed to compute the PI algorithms on the data collected in the experiments on the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform.

## [`docs`](docs) and [`examples`](examples)
These directories contains the documentation of the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform, and some examples of data acquisition.
 
>Data examples come form early experiments and due to the COVID-19 delays the final platform data will probably differ from the one proposed.
