# EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE Platform

This single repository contains three main sections regarding all the aspects of the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform.

All the details can be find inside each directory.

## [`code_testbed`](code_testbed)

This code is aimed to control the pendulum of the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform to perform several type of experiments on a given target, and gather the sensor measurements that will be used to estimate the stability under certain perturbations.

## [`Dysturbance_Pi`](Dysturbance_Pi)

This code is aimed to compute the PI algorithms on the data collected in the experiments on the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform.

## [`docs`](docs)

These directories contains the documentation of the EUROBENCH DYSTURBANCE platform.
