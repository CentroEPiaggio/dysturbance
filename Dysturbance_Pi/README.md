# PI DYSTURBANCE

The Performance Indicator computation for Dysturbance Testbench is implemented in MATLAB.
Further modifications are still needed to be used within the Eurobench Benchmarking Software.

## Purposes

Characterize the balancing performances of robotic subjects under external disturbances.
Technical details on the folder structure are provided in [src/README.md](src/README.md)

## Usage

There are two distinct scripts for the PI computation of the DYSTURBANCE testbed:

1. `run_local_pi` computes the PI for a specific run on a series of experiments on a given subject.

   Args (all required):
   1. an input `.csv` file containing the experiment data;
   2. an input `.yaml` file containing the experiment info (testbed, conditions, etc...)
   3. an input `.yaml` file containing the subject info
   4. an output directory where the results is stored

2. `run_global_pi` computes the PI for a given protocol on the whole series of experiments on a given subject.

   Args (all required):
    1. an input directory containing all the data of the tested subject
    2. an integer which identifies the protocol to be evaluated (1-5)
    3. an output directory where the results is stored

Assuming folder `./tests/data/input` contains all the raw input data, and that `./tests/data/output` exists and will contain the resulting files, the shell command examples are:

1. ```console
   ./run_local_pi ./tests/data/input/subject_1/protocol_1/subject_1_cond_1008203500/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_1008203500_run_0_platformData.csv ./tests/data/input/subject_1/protocol_1/subject_1_cond_1008203500/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_1008203500_testbed.yaml ./tests/data/input/subject_1/subject_1_info.yaml ./tests/data/output/subject_1/protocol_1
   ```

2. ```console
   ./run_global_pi ./tests/data/input/subject_1 1 ./tests/data/output
   ```

It is not possible to provide a number of arguments as inputs different from the specified one.

The code will automatically open and run MATLAB, providing a set of plots and .csv file containing the results of the PI computation.

## docker usage

__Warning: This is only valid from Linux machines. Tested with `Matlab R2021a`.__

A Docker image can be generated by launch the script [docker_gen](../docker_gen.m) from the Matlab GUI, or directly from the command line:

```console
matlab -batch docker_gen
```

An image is also deployed onto [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eurobenchtest/pi_dysturbance):

```console
docker pull eurobenchtest/pi_dysturbance
```

Then the image can be used as follows (for subject1, protocol5, assuming folder `out` has been previously created, and being at the root of the repository to access to reference data):

```console
# from subject 1, protocol 1
docker run --rm -v $PWD/Dysturbance_Pi/tests/data/input/subject_1:/in -v $PWD/out:/out pi_dysturbance /in/protocol_1/subject_1_cond_1008203500/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_1008203500_run_0_platformData.csv /in/protocol_1/subject_1_cond_1008203500/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_1008203500_testbed.yaml /in/subject_1_info.yaml /out

# from subject 1, protocol 2
docker run --rm -v $PWD/Dysturbance_Pi/tests/data/input/subject_1:/in -v $PWD/out:/out pi_dysturbance /in/protocol_2/subject_1_cond_2101000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_2101000000_run_49_platformData.csv /in/protocol_2/subject_1_cond_2101000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_2101000000_testbed.yaml /in/subject_1_info.yaml /out

# from subject 1, protocol 3
docker run --rm -v $PWD/Dysturbance_Pi/tests/data/input/subject_1:/in -v $PWD/out:/out pi_dysturbance /in/protocol_3/subject_1_cond_3021000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_3021000000_run_0_platformData.csv /in/protocol_3/subject_1_cond_3021000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_3021000000_testbed.yaml /in/subject_1_info.yaml /out

# from subject 1, protocol 4
docker run --rm -v $PWD/Dysturbance_Pi/tests/data/input/subject_1:/in -v $PWD/out:/out pi_dysturbance /in/protocol_4/subject_1_cond_4000000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_4000000000_run_0_platformData.csv /in/protocol_4/subject_1_cond_4000000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_4000000000_testbed.yaml /in/subject_1_info.yaml /out

# from subject 1, protocol 5
docker run --rm -v $PWD/Dysturbance_Pi/tests/data/input/subject_1:/in -v $PWD/out:/out pi_dysturbance /in/protocol_5/subject_1_cond_5000000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_5000000000_run_0_platformData.csv /in/protocol_5/subject_1_cond_5000000000/raw_data_input/subject_1_cond_5000000000_testbed.yaml /in/subject_1_info.yaml /out
```
